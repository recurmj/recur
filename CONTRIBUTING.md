# Contributing to Recur

Thank you for your interest in the Recur project.  
This repository hosts the **public reference copy of the Recur Whitepaper** and related documentation.

At this stage, Recur is a **published specification**, not an open-source software project.  
For that reason, direct edits, pull requests, or code changes are not being accepted.

### Feedback & Discussion

If you have:
- technical feedback on the permissioned-pull model,
- clarifications on the whitepaper language, or
- implementation questions for integration,

please open an **Issue** instead of a Pull Request.  
Use clear, constructive language and reference the relevant section or page of the paper.
